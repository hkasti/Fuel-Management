# Fuel-Management
# In this project the goal is to cut off the fuel access when either accident is detetced or the car door is locked. In order to do so we used esp32 for our micro-controller, the esp32 connects to a mobile app via wifi. We also used a 5v Relay to simulate the fuel access. We used a Code Fix Transmitter 315 MHz Car Remote and a RXB61 Wireless Receiver 315 MHz to simulate the process of locking and unlocking the car door.Additionally, we Implemented a function to be capable of decoding every car remote signal by forming a tri-state buffer to construct all the states of a pushed remote button. For detecting an accident we used a ADXL345 (3 Axis Accelerometer) which triggers the fuel access to be cut off.
